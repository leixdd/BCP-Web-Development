<p>Bestlink College of the Philippines is a non-stock, non-profit and non-sectarian institute founded in June 2002 in Quezon City. The emergence of 4-Year CHED ladderized programs changed its name from an institute with Computer TESDA-accredited courses to a college.</p>

<p>The school is committed in providing quality education to our youth especially those belonging to the marginalized families who cannot afford to send and sustain them in college by subsidizing student&rsquo;s tuition through the Tawag ng Panginoon Foundation, Inc. The foundation, which is founded by the owner and president of the school, is committed to support the less fortunate youth by providing scholarship programs. That&rsquo;s precisely the reason why 100% of our students are graduates of public secondary schools coming from Quezon City, Caloocan City, Valenzuela and Bulacan. At present, the school has approximately 15,000 enrollees, all of whom are scholars of the said foundation, paying only the miscellaneous fees.</p>

<p>Although the school requires only minimal fees, it still meets and provides adequate facilities and services not to mention the competent and qualified instructors eagerly and enthusiastically extending and sharing their help for the welfare of the studentry.</p>
