<p><strong>BESTLINK COLLEGE OF THE PHILIPPINES&nbsp;</strong>(<em>formerly BESTLINK INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</em>) was established in June 2002 at Sacred Heart Village, Caloocan City by the generous and charitable Madame Mary M. Vicente, President, and Engineer Reynaldo Corpuz, Administrator.</p>

<p>The school was initially named &ldquo;<em>LOG-ON TODAY</em>&rdquo;, but the management later decided to change it. Inspired by the phrase,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Be trained to be the best; be linked to success&rdquo;</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>BESTLINK&nbsp;</strong>came out to be more appropriate. Since Bestlink offers computer-based courses, finally, it was decided to name the school&nbsp;<strong>BESTLINK INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</strong>.</p>

<p>With its mission and vision of providing holistic training, Bestlink started with four (4) TESDA-accredited computer courses. These are Computer System Design and Programming, Computerized Office Management, Computer Technology and Networking, and Computer Graphics and Web Development.</p>

<p>Bestlink started its operation with seven (7) students: five (5) from Computerized Office Management and two (2) from Computer System Design and Programming. Thus, Bestlink then, had only four (4) faculty members. They were Engr. Reynaldo Corpuz, Math Instructor and Administrator, Mr. Vincent Carlo Garados, Computer Instructor and IT Coordinator, Respicio Siringan, English Instructor, and Ms. Marimel Loya, Office Management Instructor, Cashier and Student Affairs and Marketing Coordinator.</p>

<p>Its first site was not sufficient for the forecasted growth. Once in 2004, Bestlink, with its new Administration headed by Engr. Diosdado T. Lleno, School Director, decided to move to its new location at 1044 Brgy. Sta. Monica, Quirino&nbsp;Hi-way, Novaliches, Quezon City. This strategic location led to a huge increase in the number of students.</p>

<p>In 2005, through the persistent and striving efforts of Engr. Lleno, School Director and Mr. Charlie Cari&ntilde;o as the Academic Consultant, Bestlink offered an additional courses, Hotel and Restaurant Services (HRS). This course incorporates seven (7) modules: Commercial Cooking, Food and Beverage Service, Housekeeping, Bartending, Baking and Pastry, Tour Guiding, and Front Office Services.</p>

<p>In 2007, with the continuous increase of students, Bestlink temporarily held its classes at Annex 1, fronting the Main Building. The following year, the school acquired three (3) lots adjacent to Greenfields I Subdivision. On the first lot stood a two-storey building which used to be a bank. This was improved by Bestlink. The ground floor served as the Administration Office and the second floor housed the school library. The second lot with its original structure was remodeled into a Mock Hotel to serve as training facility for HRS students, and also, to suit the needs of the College. A five-storey building was constructed on the third lot to provide the increasing number of enrollees with quality facilities in line with its vision of providing quality education. Hence, a new structure was added on the vacant space of the 3rd&nbsp;lot, to serve as cooking lab-training room of HRS students. The HRS laboratory and other facilities were transferred to the newly-built Mock Hotel. It was inaugurated in August 2008.</p>

<p>Its expansion efforts contained an increase in course offerings. Bestlink started to offer the CHED ladderized program (4-year degree courses): BSIT and BSHRM. Its Permit to Operate (PTO) was granted by CHED on January 2009, and currently being operationalized.</p>

<p>The continuous search for ways to offer quality education to poor but deserving students did not stop as Bestlink offered additional 4-year CHED courses in 2010-2011, namely:&nbsp; BSBA, BSOA, BSED/BEED, and BSCrim.&nbsp; The said additional courses brought in additional enrollees that reached its peak at approximately thirteen thousand (13,000).</p>

<p>With the school&rsquo;s desire to cater to more students, a vacant lot situated at Lot 762 Cor. Topaz St. and Sapphire St., Millionaire&rsquo;s Village, San Agustin, Novaliches, Quezon City and with a land area of 9,305 sq.m., was purchased on February 17, 2012.&nbsp; The acquisition of the said property is indeed a blessing for the entire BCP family.&nbsp; Just the sight of it gives hope to thousands of students who wish to pursue their education in college. However, not everything runs smoothly.&nbsp; It also experienced challenges but in the end, all is well that ends well.&nbsp; Noteworthy to mention is the support of the Former Bgy. San Agustin Chairman Mr. Andy Palma, Millionaire&rsquo;s Village Homeowner&rsquo;s Association officers and members, and the lot owner, Gonzales Family.&nbsp; They wholeheartedly supported the intention of building a school within the area.&nbsp; The endorsements of Bishop Antonio Tobias and Quezon City Mayor, Hon. Herbert Baustista on February 2012 and March 2012, respectively, also did their share to win the support of Quezon City Council in a hearing attended by Ms. Edith Vicente, Corporate Secretary, Sr. Domnina Basqui&ntilde;ez, and Dr. Charlie Cari&ntilde;o, who is very eager to justify why the school must be given exemption from Regulations on Medium Density Residential Zone.&nbsp; With an open mind and a kind heart, fortunately, the council heard the plea.&nbsp; Finally, the building permit was released on July 24, 2013.</p>

<p>In December 2012, another opportunity knocked when a vacant school building in Bulacan was discovered.&nbsp; After a series of negotiations, it has finally become Bestlink&rsquo;s property on January 10, 2013. Not long after, on March 13, 2013, Bestlink took over and occupied the said building.&nbsp; Its Business Permit was granted on March 22, 2013.&nbsp; The Inauguration which signaled the start of a new beginning for Bestlink Bulacan was held on August 7, 2013, and was attended by the following:&nbsp; local government officials headed by Bulacan City Mayor Hon. Reynaldo San Pedro; distinguished guests, namely:&nbsp; Dr. Virginia Akiate, Director IV-CHED Region III and Mrs. Luz Victoria G. Amponin, TESDA Provincial Director; BCP administrative officers; faculty and staff; students and their respective parents.&nbsp; Classes started on August 12, 2013, with 841 students taking up TESDA courses.</p>

<p>Now that the school has gained more success through the collaborative participation of the administration, faculty, staff, studentry, parents, and the community as well, Bestlink has indeed proven its desire to excel in the cause of taking functional and educational leadership in the tertiary level.</p>
