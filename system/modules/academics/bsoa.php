				echo '<p>Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA) is a four year degree program designed to provide students with knowledge and skills in business management and office processes needed in different workplaces such as general business offices, legal or medical offices.</p>

<p>The BSOA program prepares students to be able to carry out clerical, administrative, supervisory and managerial tasks. In addition, the program also trains students to develop their skills in keyboarding, filling, shorthand and stenography.</p>

<p>There are some schools who offer a ladderized curriculum for the BSOA program. For each year level a student completes, he/she receives a proficiency certificate. The proficiency certificate is granted to students who passed the competency test administered by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). However, completion of the four-year course entitles a student a full degree which will qualify him/her for higher positions.</p>
