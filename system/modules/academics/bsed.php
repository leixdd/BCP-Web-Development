				echo '<p>Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED) is a four year degree program designed to prepare students for becoming high school teachers. The program combines both theory and practice in order to teach students the necessary knowledge and skills a high school teacher needs. The BSEd program trains students to teach one of the different learning areas such as English, Mathematics, General Science, Filipino, Social Studies, Biological Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health (MAPEH) and Home Economics and Livelihood Education.<br />
Subjects and Curriculum</p>

<p>The BSED curriculum contains Professional Education subjects that can be classified into four major categories:</p>

<p>Theory and Concepts subjects: Child and Adolescent Development, Social Dimensions of Education<br />
Methods and Strategies subjects: Principles of Teaching, Assessment of Student Learning<br />
Field Study subjects: Practice Teaching, Field Study<br />
Elective subjects: Teaching Multicultural Classrooms, Integrative Teaching Strategies.</p>

<p>The first three years of the Bachelor of Secondary Education program are spent in classroom discussions, oral recitations and role plays. In addition, there is a Major&rsquo;s Forum, which is a weekly session, wherein students are given opportunities to review and communicate what they have learned/experienced, be aware of current issues and trends in education and to discuss matters relevant to teacher education and the teaching profession.</p>

<p>During the fourth year, students undergo teaching internships in secondary schools where they are able to act like professional teachers and experience the life in actual classroom work. This is done under the supervision of the class adviser who will also conduct periodic evaluation on the assigned student teacher.</p>

<p>Depending on the field of specialization a student chooses, an undergraduate research paper may be required as a prerequisite for graduation. This is done under the guidance of a faculty and ends when the student faces a committee to defend his/her work.</p>
